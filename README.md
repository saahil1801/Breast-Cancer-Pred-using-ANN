# Breast-Cancer-Pred-using-ANN

Predicting breast cancer diagnosis using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with the scikit-learn datasets. This project aims to demonstrate the power of machine learning in predicting breast cancer.

Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, available through scikit-learn's built-in datasets. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features are computed for each cell nucleus, and the goal is to predict whether the mass is benign (0) or malignant (1).
